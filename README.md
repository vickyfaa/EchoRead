# EchoRead Text Summarizer

A web-based text summarization application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create concise summaries of long articles and documents.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Text Summarization**: Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) based scoring to identify the most important sentences
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Choose how many sentences you want in your summary (1-10+ sentences)
- **Clean Web Interface**: Modern, responsive design with intuitive user experience
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant summarization without external API dependencies
- **Stop Word Filtering**: Automatically filters out common words to focus on meaningful content

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EchoRead
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask nltk
   ```

3. **Download NLTK data** (required for the first run)
   ```bash
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('punkt')"
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the summarizer

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Paste your text**: Copy and paste any long article, document, or text into the text area
2. **Set summary length**: Choose how many sentences you want in your summary (default: 3)
3. **Click "Summarize!"**: The application will process your text and display the summary
4. **Review results**: The summary appears below the form with the most important sentences highlighted

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask web framework
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS with modern styling
- **NLP Engine**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Summarization Algorithm**: TF-IDF based sentence scoring

### How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: The input text is tokenized into sentences and words
2. **Stop Word Removal**: Common words (the, is, at, etc.) are filtered out
3. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Important words are identified based on frequency
4. **Sentence Scoring**: Each sentence is scored based on the importance of its words
5. **Summary Generation**: The top-scoring sentences are selected and combined

### Key Components

- `app.py`: Main Flask application with summarization logic
- `index.html`: Web interface template
- `Summarizer` class: Core NLP processing engine

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
EchoRead/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py          # Main Flask application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Web interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/          # Git repository
```

## üîß Customization

### Modifying Summary Length
The default summary length is 3 sentences. You can change this in the HTML form or modify the `num_sentences` parameter in the Flask route.

### Adding New Features
The modular design makes it easy to extend:
- Add new summarization algorithms in the `Summarizer` class
- Enhance the UI with additional styling
- Integrate with external APIs for enhanced processing
